**Optimized YOLO variants for faster inference with maintained accuracy**

---

## Overview

This project implements **lightweight versions** of classic YOLO architectures to reduce inference time while preserving detection accuracy. We developed two compact variants and compared them against YOLOv8.

**Goal:** Optimize inference speed without significant accuracy loss

## Implemented Models

- **YOLO v1 Tiny** - Compact version of original YOLO architecture
- **YOLO v2 Tiny** - Lightweight YOLOv2 variant
- **YOLOv8** - Baseline comparison model

## Results

Our optimized variants achieved:
- **Reduced inference time** compared to standard models
- **Maintained detection accuracy** on test datasets
- **Efficient architecture** suitable for real-time applications
